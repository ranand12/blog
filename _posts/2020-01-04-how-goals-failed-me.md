 _Voice in my head: Why on earth would someone want to listen to my systems or routine ???! You must be crazy. 
 I acknowledge but still ignore the voice and continue writing, Why ?? You have these folks to blame - [Dona Sarkar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEOvAu0knsU) , [Obvious to you, amazing to others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcmI5SSQLmE) and [Show Your Work](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X)._
 



I have always been a very ambitious goal setter all my life, but have been a terrible failure when it comes to execution - it would never last more than a few days. Something changed in 2019, I re-/read these amazing books -

* [Deep Work - Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)
* [How to fail at almost everything and still win big - Scott Adams](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4)
* [Atomic habits - James Clear](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)

If you haven't read these books - stop reading this post and go read those books - will be a better use of your time

Extracting the essence from these three books, I am now a strong believer of incremental tiny boring progress and building a system rather than an ambitious fancy goal. This has helped me have the longest streak to sticking to these routines.

## **<u>Mindfulness Meditation</u>** 

 I'm not going to delve into the benefits of mindfulness, there are a gazillion articles out there. For me this is a [keystone](https://mayooshin.com/keystone-habits/) habit - and the most important one

* ### What do I do 
  I practice this method. In plain English here's what I do - focus and observe your breath and body sensations - in a nonjudgmental and equanimous way - THATâ€™S IT - it's as simple as that - I SWEAR. I try to aim for 20 mins/day but I'm not too ambitious even if I can get done 1 minute - I consider that a win for the day ( [Systems v/s goals](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems))
* ### How has it helped me 
  Focus, Clarity and creativity - it's amazing how these foundational skills affect every single aspect of your life

## **<u>Screen time</u>** 

Screen addiction is real. If I was bored or when I was in the train with nothing to do - I used to stare at my phone screen. I had to change this, because I have had a taste of how useful boredom can be for creativity in the past - but never managed to stick to the discipline.

* ### What did I do
  
  I followed Cal Newport's [advice](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515) - uninstalled all the apps which was distracting the most (for me it was - WhatsApp, Facebook) for 30 days.
* ### How has it helped me 
  
  It helped me feel ["boredom"](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/clive-thompson-7/) again !! I know this sounds crazy - but trust me boredom is super essential. And now I have reinstalled the apps and use a screen time limit of 6mins/day - so it's more intentional when I use these apps.
  
## **<u>One new thing a day</u>** 

I used to mindlessly consume lots of content and not really absorbing it or internalizing it.

* ### What did I do
Starting late 2019, I have a tiny book where I make 1 or 2 sentence notes of what I learned that day (kept it small and atomic) - it could be from a [podcast guest](https://azuremonk.com/audio/), my customers and colleagues who I work with, an article/book/video I watched, my 1.5 year daughter, my wife, the cashier at Walmart -ANYONE.

* ### How has it helped me
I feel terrible when I miss a day of note taking, so all day this subconsciously helps put me in a mindset where I make it a point to learn at least one thing. I personally feel having this mindset has helped me learn and absorb so much from the amazing people around me and has provided me with new opportunities.

## **<u>What I aim to add in 2020</u>** 

* ### Physical exercise
I'm aiming for 10 minutes/day of really slow jogging and gradually add on if and when I feel comfortable.

* ### Morning pages
[Here](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman) is how to do it -750 free flowing words as soon as you wake up. The few days I have written morning pages in the past - I have had really crazy unique ideas and I had no idea how they came to me, which have totally caught me by surprise. But again this requires a certain discipline and I'm hoping to build this muscle this year.
