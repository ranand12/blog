He talks about how he has the ‚Äúcoolest job‚Äù since he has to solve a business problem only once but can be reused many number of times. We talk about how he was instrumental in solving a business problem which was ‚Äì making a parking gate ‚Äúsmart‚Äù using Azure and its IOT capabilities.

Enjoy listening !

**AJ‚Äôs journey on how he got to where he is today**

*   AJ talks about how he started off with Oracle and how he started off with a blank state in Azure when he joined Microsoft but quickly mapped & translated the syntax from Oracle and AWS to Azure
*   AJ talks about how he has the coolest job by working with industry solutions in the ISV space. AJ solves a business problem once but the solution he develops can scale ‚Äì thanks to partners who help amplify his solution to 100-1000s of customers

**Interesting projects that AJ has worked on ‚Äì**

*   A leader in parking management wanted their Kiosks, gate to be intelligent and dynamic fare based system. The challenges were the parking were 5 levels underground and had no internet connectivity. Azure IoT was used to solve this business problem ‚Äì including OCR, Azure edge camera for License plate reading. This also gave them additional value added services like ‚Äì differential pricing based on demands, monitoring the parking spots, categorize the car by frequent customers and more.

**AJ defined what a ‚Äúgood day‚Äù and a ‚Äúbad day‚Äù is for him ‚Äì**

*   Good day:
    *   True business impact which tangible results than just a technical solution
    *   Seeing his impact in real world
*   Bad day:

*   *   Unhappy Customers

**AJ‚Äôs advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space ‚Äì**

*   Categorizing oneself as a pillared solution category expert ‚Äì may not be a good idea. The real world doesn‚Äôt work that way ‚Äì they do not hear solutions or products, what they want is industry problems. In order to solve this he had to stop wearing the hat of a ‚Äúpillared solution expert‚Äù model. He now prefers calling himself a **_‚Äúproblem solver‚Äù_** rather than a _Data & AI Architect_ or _Apps & Infra architect_ with a **_‚Äúhip‚Äù pocket skill._**

**AJ‚Äôs advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world ‚Äì**

*   He is more of an audio/visual learner
*   [Azure Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficeGarageSeries), [Azure Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-MXgaFhsYU8PkqgKBdnusQ), and Channel 9 video contents are something that he goes back to for an update on the features.
*   For day-to-day updates he prefers following updates blog

**How to get in touch with AJ**

*   LinkedIn ‚Äì [https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijeetjhala/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijeetjhala/)
*   His future blog link will be posted here üôÇ
