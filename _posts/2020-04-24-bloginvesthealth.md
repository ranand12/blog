What does blogging (or creating any online content), investing, and physical health have in common ? Here are the common patterns I have seen across the three domains (and life in general too) - let me know if you agree/disagree



**<u>Analysis Paralysis</u>** 

1. **Investing** - Mutual Funds, stocks, options, futures, 401k !!  -so many options to choose from. What I have [learned](https://jlcollinsnh.com/) is that [keeping it simple is super](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2017/03/09/9-money-rules-index-card/#6e35a83e2c09) helpful even when it comes to investing.  
2. **Creating online content** - Should my domain be a .com .io or .dev  ? What about the logo ? Shouldn't the name be catchy ? What theme should I choose ? I'm not saying these things don't matter, but nothing is more important than the content and what you have to say - [just sit down, defeat the resistance and start creating the content](https://www.azuremonk.com/blog/warofart)
3. **Physical health** - Should I join this fancy boutique gym?  soul cycle? orange theory fitness? should I have a personal trainer? Start simple - but it is more important to start even if it means going out for a run or just using a pair of dumbbells'

**<u>Consistency over intensity</u>** 

1. **Investing**  - You have all heard of "[dollar cost averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp)". It is more important to be consistent to build wealth in the long run than trying to time the market. 
2. **Creating online content** - Like I said earlier, don't be like me - create one content in 2012 and wait another 8 years to produce the next one. [Be consistent, show up.](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/11EssentialCharacteristicsForBeingAGoodTechnicalAdvocateOrInterviewer.aspx) 
3. **Physical health** - You don't build good health by doing workouts for 3 hours/day for one month and nothing for the next 11 months. Regular consistent manageable workouts are what lead to good health.

**<u>But I'm not there yet</u>** 

1. **Investing** - The common excuse we all have is - "I just don't have enough money to start investing" - even starting of with 100 bucks can make a huge difference. Time and the [power of compounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zf7zob1Xdc) are your friends here
2. **Creating online content** - But I don't have any good things to say yet, I'm not an expert on anything. Doesn't matter - document your learning process. You don't believe me ? [The community needs you](https://twitter.com/ranand12/status/1252579324978507776)
3. **Physical health** - "But I'm overweight or too week" - That's precisely the reason to start. Start BECAUSE you are not there yet.

**<u>Process is the reward</u>** 

1. **Investing** -  Of course the wealth that is built is what we aim for - but hey the discipline of saving and investing and the habit building is the reward

2. **Creating online content** - The ability to articulate thoughts, teach and present content to others itself is the reward. That skill is invaluable when you are talking to the customer, designing a solution and working with other teams. 

3. **Physical health** - The weight loss or the muscle gain at the end of 2 years is not the reward. Your physical health, mood elevation on a day-to-day basis is the reward.

**<u>Ignore Setbacks</u>**

1. **Investing** - You understand this if you are a long term investor - there WILL be a downward spiral, there WILL be a recession and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it - it is just part of investing. Ignore the setback
2. **Creating online content** - I created my first video in 2012, the first video got ~20k views, was super pumped did my second video and that got 300 views. What did I do ? Any self respecting tech guy would do - yes I QUIT. Don't be like me. 
3. **Physical health** - You start doing strength training for a week and suddenly your arms go sore - what do you do ? Quit - because that's easy. Ignore the setback.

I'm writing this more as a reminder to myself to continue to follow these principles.
