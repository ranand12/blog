**Sarah’s journey on how she got to where she is today (01:41)**

*   Sarah joined MSFT in 2017 as a Cloud Solution Architect
*   She transitioned to the Cloud advocate role a couple of months ago. Her role as a cloud advocate is to be an evangelist to Microsoft products ( she focusses on the ITPro audience), collect feedback from customers and bridging the gap between customers feedback and product engineers.

**Interesting projects that Sarah has worked on (03:37)**

*   She talks about how she specializes in data center migration. She also talks about the “[Azure Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-migrate/)” – how they were using it, how they should be using it and how she influenced the product with the feedback provided.
*   Some of her feedback that was incorporated into the products include the inclusion of [importing CSV files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/tutorial-assess-import) and import it into azure migrate – which was announced at MS Ignite.

**Sarah’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (06:45)**

*   [MSLearn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) – Leverage MSLearn – it has free and has different learning paths for varying skill levels.
*   Local Azure Meetup groups – She encourages joining local azure user groups and learning from other people. Examples include – [Glasgow user group](https://twitter.com/GlasgowAzureUG) which she runs. [_If you are in the NYC region also check out the following user group that we host –_ [https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Public-Sector-Meet-Up/](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Public-Sector-Meet-Up/) ]

**Sarah’s advice to keep herself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (09:40)**

*   She uses twitter to keep herself updated on everything that is happening and everything that people are talking about – she follows customers and Azure Program managers. She listens to the community and understands the latest trends and what is important.
*   She also has started a Youtube channel where she posts regular updates on Azure.

**Sarah defines what a “good day” and a “bad day” is for her (12:10)**

*   Good day – Almost every day, specifically when people find the content she shared or created useful and provide her feedback on it
*   Bad day – when travel schedules get messed up
