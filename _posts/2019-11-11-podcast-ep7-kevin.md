**Kevin‚Äôs journey on how he got to where he is today (02:08)**

*   Went to school business information technology and how he wanted to be anything but a programmer ‚Äì but that‚Äôs where life got him üôÇ
*   He started off as a software developer, and how he took the process of reconciling bar exams from few days to a couple of hours.
*   What drew him to the cloud was how it helped him to do things and create more impact in an easy and fast way
*   His first cloud solution ‚Äì Early learning solution for parents
*   He now works as with Independent Software Vendors (ISV) in the State and Local Government space

**Interesting projects that Kevin has worked on (06:03)**

*   **_Project #1_** ‚Äì Business problem ‚Äì Achieve massive data processing in a really quick way ‚Äì 100s of TB data on premise. He also talks about how he optimized the solution, making it compute & cost effective using Azure technologies. He had the opportunity to work on latest technologies like Lucene, Casandra.
*   **_Project #2_** ‚Äì Biggest impact for ISV solutions that he works on is high availability ‚Äì a downtime of single service or a server means all their customers are affected. How composite SLAs are more important than SLAs for each service. He also talks about how monitoring is critical ‚Äì when we layer in services like Kubernetes and microservices.

**Kevin‚Äôs advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (14:44)**

*   Kevin talks about how his past life as a professor for the course ‚ÄúIntro to web development‚Äù, taught him all he needs to know about debugging, about how to boil down complex tech concepts and explain it in a way that makes sense. This skill of ‚Äúsimplification‚Äù really helps a Cloud Solution Architect in the following ways
    *   Help build rapport and make the customer comfortable to ask questions
    *   Empowers the Cloud Solution Architect to give and relay information and most importantly empower you to not know information.
    *   _‚ÄúThe first time we are absolutely in our right to not know the answer, but the second time we are not.‚Äù_ ‚Äì Advice he got when he started off in Microsoft
*   He runs through his chalk talk with his wife who doesn‚Äôt have a tech background and uses it as an alpha/beta test before delivering it to the real audience ‚Äì the principle being if someone who is non-tech can get it, anyone can get it
*   **_Explain and simplify the complex_** ‚Äì is what he feels is the biggest strength anyone can possess
*   Anyone can gain this skill ‚Äì there are enough community colleges which need professor. But if you can‚Äôt be a professor, find a user/meetup group ‚Äì pick a topic to deliver which will force yourself to learn it.

**Kevin‚Äôs advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (22:50)**

*   When he wants to learn anything new, and to conquer competing priorities ‚Äì he sets a timeline by which he will write a blog post about a new technology that will force him to learn and deliver on the topic.
*   He picks on trends from the customer he is working with and learns about them.
*   How yours truly, uses Kevin‚Äôs blog series ‚Äúweekly series‚Äù to keep up with all the latest technologies.
