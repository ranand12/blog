I"a<p>in my day job i work as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/ranand12">cloud solution architect at microsoft</a> serving the new york city metro region. when i’m not working i’m keeping up with the new cool cloud-y things, meditating, biking or creating online content.</p>

<p>the cloud computing space is facing a “tappers and listeners” problem and this site is my humble attempt at bridging the gap. like a wise man once said</p>

<p>“you don’t really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother”</p>
