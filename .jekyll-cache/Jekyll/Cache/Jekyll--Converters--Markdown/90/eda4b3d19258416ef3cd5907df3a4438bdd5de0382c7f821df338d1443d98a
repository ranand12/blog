<p>I have always been a very ambitious goal setter all my life, but have been a terrible failure when it comes to execution - it would never last more than a few days. Something changed in 2019, I re-/read these amazing books -</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work - Cal Newport</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4">How to fail at almost everything and still win big - Scott Adams</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299">Atomic habits - James Clear</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven’t read these books - stop reading this post and go read those books - will be a better use of your time</p>

<p>Extracting the essence from these three books, I am now a strong believer of incremental tiny boring progress and building a system rather than an ambitious fancy goal. This has helped me have the longest streak to sticking to these routines.</p>

<h2 id="mindfulness-meditation"><strong><u>Mindfulness Meditation</u></strong></h2>

<p>I’m not going to delve into the benefits of mindfulness, there are a gazillion articles out there. For me this is a <a href="https://mayooshin.com/keystone-habits/">keystone</a> habit - and the most important one</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="what-do-i-do">What do I do</h3>
    <p>I practice this method. In plain English here’s what I do - focus and observe your breath and body sensations - in a nonjudgmental and equanimous way - THAT’S IT - it’s as simple as that - I SWEAR. I try to aim for 20 mins/day but I’m not too ambitious even if I can get done 1 minute - I consider that a win for the day ( <a href="https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems">Systems v/s goals</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="how-has-it-helped-me">How has it helped me</h3>
    <p>Focus, Clarity and creativity - it’s amazing how these foundational skills affect every single aspect of your life</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screen-time"><strong><u>Screen time</u></strong></h2>

<p>Screen addiction is real. If I was bored or when I was in the train with nothing to do - I used to stare at my phone screen. I had to change this, because I have had a taste of how useful boredom can be for creativity in the past - but never managed to stick to the discipline.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="what-did-i-do">What did I do</h3>

    <p>I followed Cal Newport’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515">advice</a> - uninstalled all the apps which was distracting the most (for me it was - WhatsApp, Facebook) for 30 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="how-has-it-helped-me-1">How has it helped me</h3>

    <p>It helped me feel <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/clive-thompson-7/">“boredom”</a> again !! I know this sounds crazy - but trust me boredom is super essential. And now I have reinstalled the apps and use a screen time limit of 6mins/day - so it’s more intentional when I use these apps.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="one-new-thing-a-day"><strong><u>One new thing a day</u></strong></h2>

<p>I used to mindlessly consume lots of content and not really absorbing it or internalizing it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="what-did-i-do-1">What did I do</h3>
    <p>Starting late 2019, I have a tiny book where I make 1 or 2 sentence notes of what I learned that day (kept it small and atomic) - it could be from a <a href="https://azuremonk.com/audio/">podcast guest</a>, my customers and colleagues who I work with, an article/book/video I watched, my 1.5 year daughter, my wife, the cashier at Walmart -ANYONE.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="how-has-it-helped-me-2">How has it helped me</h3>
    <p>I feel terrible when I miss a day of note taking, so all day this subconsciously helps put me in a mindset where I make it a point to learn at least one thing. I personally feel having this mindset has helped me learn and absorb so much from the amazing people around me and has provided me with new opportunities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-aim-to-add-in-2020"><strong><u>What I aim to add in 2020</u></strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="physical-exercise">Physical exercise</h3>
    <p>I’m aiming for 10 minutes/day of really slow jogging and gradually add on if and when I feel comfortable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="morning-pages">Morning pages</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman">Here</a> is how to do it -750 free flowing words as soon as you wake up. The few days I have written morning pages in the past - I have had really crazy unique ideas and I had no idea how they came to me, which have totally caught me by surprise. But again this requires a certain discipline and I’m hoping to build this muscle this year.</p>
