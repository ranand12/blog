        "excerpt":"                                   Welcome to the “Cloud Solution Architect” podcast where we talk to Azure architects from across the globe and discuss interesting and creative Azure solutions. For more podcast episodes, animated azure video lessons and simplified how-to Azure articles please visit www.azuremonk.com   In this episode we talk with Joe Sarabia who works as a Cloud Solution Architect in Microsoft   We talk about Joe’s variety of experiences working on and with all the major private and public cloud providers out there including VMWare, Google, AWS and now Microsoft. We also talk about the book – Phoenix project, how he bought low-cost discounted machines at his local Fry’s store to learn NT migration, how he likes to “build stuff” to keep up with his “continuous learning” methodology and much more valuable advice to anyone in the tech space. We also talk about two of his interesting projects that he has worked on – one focused around people and other around technology.   Enjoy listening !   Joe’s journey on how he got to where he is today (02:02)      Joe talks about how he started off as an enthusiast by building his “home lab”, then working in weather service and how he worked his way through IT operations. He talks about how an incident where transitioning from a BCDR strategy of “shut down” when a disaster happened to using VMWare solutions, changed the game for him and his business. That’s when he learnt that technology can be a business driver. From there he transitioned over to Amazon and Google in the public cloud arena, and now in Microsoft – one of his main drivers for choosing Microsoft is the relationship and the understanding of enterprise and the flexibility of work to balance work   Defines his “good” and “bad” day at work (08:57)      Good day:            Solving a diverse and complex problem.       When things start to click for the organization (especially around DevOps – he references the book “The Phoenix project”)           Bad day:            When he can’t solve the business problem, when they need or want to – due to certain technological restraint/limitations.           The interesting projects Joe has worked on and has made a big impact (12:19)           Project #1 – Azure DevOps – He defines DevOps as – People, Process and Product -and the product side being the easiest – like they mention in the Phoenix project. He gives an example of how one of his customers had several silos inside the organization. All the teams at his customer were using different versions of TFS and were looking to migrate TFS to VSTS online and Azure Devops. He had to bring all the dev teams in the same room and talk about current state analysis, future state analysis and gap analysis. Each team had their own pocket of excellence. When the customer realized this and they started learning from the inhouse talent of how the other teams were leveraging technology – it was a moment of dissolving the silos and how he was able to get the people working together.            Project #2 – Joe talks about how application insights helped his customer resolve sporadic errors and performance issue patterns. With the power of telemetry from application insights they were able to identify with a click of a button, it as something that coincides with calls back from the database and the RCA was the DBA team was performing maintenance without letting the application team know.       Joe’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (23:41)      Having a computer science degree helped him out, although he thinks it may not be a mandatory requirement currently.   Ability to write lightweight code, and understanding both the infrastructure and app side gives him an advantage.   Leverage the free tier (or pay if necessary) to play around with the features.   Building your own website to build a blog will teach you a lot.   Attend or host user groups local to the place you live in. Leverage the educational benefits or discounts that all the major cloud providers provide.   Build stuff – applications ( he gives an example of his friend who built a game not because “he should” but because “he can”   Joe’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (31:07)      He uses feedly or a similar RSS feed aggregator for keeping up with all of the updates as a daily routine   He uses “pattern recognition” to keep himself ahead of the curve when it comes to new technologies – example Kubernetes   “Continuous learning” is critical – not just gets hands dirty but “keep your hands dirty” !   There is a lot of overlap between all the major cloud providers and identify and having a strategy to learn around it helps.   He has broken many things along with many “oops” moments – but this is what makes his experience valuable – Keep at it !!

For more podcast episodes, animated azure video lessons and simplified how-to Azure articles please visit www.azuremonk.com   In this episode we talk with Abhijeet Jhala (AJ) who works as a Cloud Solution Architect with ISVs.   He talks about how he has the “coolest job” since he has to solve a business problem only once but can be reused many number of times. We talk about how he was instrumental in solving a business problem which was – making a parking gate “smart” using Azure and its IOT capabilities. He also talks about how having a breadth of technical experience and a hip pocket skill helps him be a “problem solver”   Enjoy listening !   AJ’s journey on how he got to where he is today      AJ talks about how he started off with Oracle and how he started off with a blank state in Azure when he joined Microsoft but quickly mapped &amp; translated the syntax from Oracle and AWS to Azure   AJ talks about how he has the coolest job by working with industry solutions in the ISV space. AJ solves a business problem once but the solution he develops can scale – thanks to partners who help amplify his solution to 100-1000s of customers   Interesting projects that AJ has worked on –      A leader in parking management wanted their Kiosks, gate to be intelligent and dynamic fare based system. The challenges were the parking were 5 levels underground and had no internet connectivity. Azure IoT was used to solve this business problem – including OCR, Azure edge camera for License plate reading. This also gave them additional value added services like – differential pricing based on demands, monitoring the parking spots, categorize the car by frequent customers and more.   AJ defined what a “good day” and a “bad day” is for him –      Good day:            True business impact which tangible results than just a technical solution       Seeing his impact in real world                Bad day:                   Unhappy Customers           AJ’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space –      Categorizing oneself as a pillared solution category expert – may not be a good idea. The real world doesn’t work that way – they do not hear solutions or products, what they want is industry problems. In order to solve this he had to stop wearing the hat of a “pillared solution expert” model. He now prefers calling himself a “problem solver” rather than a Data &amp; AI Architect or Apps &amp; Infra architect with a “hip” pocket skill.   AJ’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world –      He is more of an audio/visual learner   Azure Mechanics, Azure Academy, and Channel 9 video contents are something that he goes back to for an update on the features.   For day-to-day updates he prefers following updates blog   How to get in touch with AJ      LinkedIn – https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijeetjhala/   His future blog link will be posted here 🙂   ","categories": ["podcast"],

        "excerpt":"                                   In this episode we talk with Kevin Mack who works as a Cloud Solution Architect with ISVs.   He talks about how his past life as a professor gave him valuable life and tech skills, like explaining and simplify for the audience &amp; also helped him sharpen his debugging skills. We also talk about how his wife made the greatest contribution to his blog, and also helps him run the alpha/beta test before delivering a session on a complex topic. We also talk about how designing for high availability is critical for the customers that he works with and he goes about designing them.   Enjoy listening !   Kevin’s journey on how he got to where he is today (02:08)      Went to school business information technology and how he wanted to be anything but a programmer – but that’s where life got him 🙂   He started off as a software developer, and how he took the process of reconciling bar exams from few days to a couple of hours.   What drew him to the cloud was how it helped him to do things and create more impact in an easy and fast way   His first cloud solution – Early learning solution for parents   He now works as with Independent Software Vendors (ISV) in the State and Local Government space   Interesting projects that Kevin has worked on (06:03)      Project #1 – Business problem – Achieve massive data processing in a really quick way – 100s of TB data on premise. He also talks about how he optimized the solution, making it compute &amp; cost effective using Azure technologies. He had the opportunity to work on latest technologies like Lucene, Casandra.   Project #2 – Biggest impact for ISV solutions that he works on is high availability – a downtime of single service or a server means all their customers are affected. How composite SLAs are more important than SLAs for each service. He also talks about how monitoring is critical – when we layer in services like Kubernetes and microservices.   Kevin’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (14:44)      Kevin talks about how his past life as a professor for the course “Intro to web development”, taught him all he needs to know about debugging, about how to boil down complex tech concepts and explain it in a way that makes sense. This skill of “simplification” really helps a Cloud Solution Architect in the following ways            Help build rapport and make the customer comfortable to ask questions       Empowers the Cloud Solution Architect to give and relay information and most importantly empower you to not know information.       “The first time we are absolutely in our right to not know the answer, but the second time we are not.” – Advice he got when he started off in Microsoft           He runs through his chalk talk with his wife who doesn’t have a tech background and uses it as an alpha/beta test before delivering it to the real audience – the principle being if someone who is non-tech can get it, anyone can get it   Explain and simplify the complex – is what he feels is the biggest strength anyone can possess   Anyone can gain this skill – there are enough community colleges which need professor. But if you can’t be a professor, find a user/meetup group – pick a topic to deliver which will force yourself to learn it.   Kevin’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (22:50)      When he wants to learn anything new, and to conquer competing priorities – he sets a timeline by which he will write a blog post about a new technology that will force him to learn and deliver on the topic.   He picks on trends from the customer he is working with and learns about them.   How yours truly, uses Kevin’s blog series “weekly series” to keep up with all the latest technologies.

We also talk about his work in the education space using deep immersive education. We also talk about how fitness plays a critical role in his focus and attention to learn new technologies.   Enjoy listening !   Mike’s journey on how he got to where he is today (02:02)      He talks about his journey from a ski lodge to AOL all the way to getting his MCSE certifications – working with Microsoft, AWS and now running his own learning and consulting company – Cloudskills.io   He also talks about how he wet his feet into the development world by working on ASP.NET and other technologies, but decided to come back into the infrastructure space where the application development skills he learnt give him an edge.   Interesting projects that Mike has worked on (08:09)      Immersive training programs – After doing 25 Pluralsight courses and LinkedIn learning courses – Mike is now designing a course which is more immersive – the content is spread over longer period of time, people get more depth experience and absorb content in better way and they have a community to stay connected to create an impact. He talks about how his students are now the co-authors for his new books (published by Microsoft Press).   Mike’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (13:04)      Don’t chase the dollar, chase your passion/goal.   Get active – use the passion. Consistently have a routine. Be organized   As tech people – we always bet on technology and learn and master it. Respect the highs and lows in the process   Complaining is not good enough, expressing viewpoints must add value – must not just be venting or shooting down a product or a service.   Mike’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (16:10)      Have a system or routine in place- wake up early at around 4 AM. Prepare for the day, learn and share. Get a focused concentrated time.   He is militant about his calendar, if it’s in his calendar – he will do it no matter what.   Observe what people are talking about and get into the conversation.   Observer what successful people are doing.

        "title": "how goals failed me - and what worked in 2019",
        "excerpt":"Voice in my head: Why on earth would someone want to listen to my systems or routine ???! You must be crazy.   I acknowledge but still ignore the voice and continue writing, Why ?? You have these folks to blame - Dona Sarkar , Obvious to you, amazing to others and Show Your Work.   I have always been a very ambitious goal setter all my life, but have been a terrible failure when it comes to execution - it would never last more than a few days. Something changed in 2019, I re-/read these amazing books -      Deep Work - Cal Newport   How to fail at almost everything and still win big - Scott Adams   Atomic habits - James Clear   If you haven’t read these books - stop reading this post and go read those books - will be a better use of your time   Extracting the essence from these three books, I am now a strong believer of incremental tiny boring progress and building a system rather than an ambitious fancy goal. This has helped me have the longest streak to sticking to these routines.   Mindfulness Meditation   I’m not going to delve into the benefits of mindfulness, there are a gazillion articles out there. For me this is a keystone habit - and the most important one           What do I do      I practice this method. In plain English here’s what I do - focus and observe your breath and body sensations - in a nonjudgmental and equanimous way - THAT’S IT - it’s as simple as that - I SWEAR. I try to aim for 20 mins/day but I’m not too ambitious even if I can get done 1 minute - I consider that a win for the day ( Systems v/s goals)            How has it helped me      Focus, Clarity and creativity - it’s amazing how these foundational skills affect every single aspect of your life       Screen time   Screen addiction is real. If I was bored or when I was in the train with nothing to do - I used to stare at my phone screen. I had to change this, because I have had a taste of how useful boredom can be for creativity in the past - but never managed to stick to the discipline.           What did I do       I followed Cal Newport’s advice - uninstalled all the apps which was distracting the most (for me it was - WhatsApp, Facebook) for 30 days.            How has it helped me       It helped me feel “boredom” again !! I know this sounds crazy - but trust me boredom is super essential. And now I have reinstalled the apps and use a screen time limit of 6mins/day - so it’s more intentional when I use these apps.       One new thing a day   I used to mindlessly consume lots of content and not really absorbing it or internalizing it.           What did I do      Starting late 2019, I have a tiny book where I make 1 or 2 sentence notes of what I learned that day (kept it small and atomic) - it could be from a podcast guest, my customers and colleagues who I work with, an article/book/video I watched, my 1.5 year daughter, my wife, the cashier at Walmart -ANYONE.            How has it helped me      I feel terrible when I miss a day of note taking, so all day this subconsciously helps put me in a mindset where I make it a point to learn at least one thing. I personally feel having this mindset has helped me learn and absorb so much from the amazing people around me and has provided me with new opportunities.       What I aim to add in 2020           Physical exercise      I’m aiming for 10 minutes/day of really slow jogging and gradually add on if and when I feel comfortable.            Morning pages      Here is how to do it -750 free flowing words as soon as you wake up. The few days I have written morning pages in the past - I have had really crazy unique ideas and I had no idea how they came to me, which have totally caught me by surprise. But again this requires a certain discipline and I’m hoping to build this muscle this year.       www.azuremonk.com  ","categories": ["productivity","blog"],

Daren talks about his experiences both with education and engineering world. He talks about a framework for “Modern Data Warehouse” which I personally feel is the single most useful thing any data architect should be implementing. Since he has a lot of amazing slides to go along with the framework explanation – this is going to be a video podcast, so please do check out the link below if you are unable to watch the video.   Daren’s journey on how he got to where he is today (1:30)      He started off as an Electronics engineer. He worked himself out of a job since he was really good at what he was supposed to do and completed the tasks on time   He then joined as a Dean and was trying to find opportunities for his students.   He was part of the first genome mapping project which then later went on to win the Noble Prize   He was the dean of a technical college – but time boxed it in order not to lose his touch with technology.   He has also worked with First American and Oracle before he joined Microsoft   Interesting projects that Daren has worked on (06:15)      20-25 years of Enterprise data warehouse that have been grown – people have violated the original design constraints and caused them to go to maintenance nightmares.   Modern Data Warehouse – using “ELT”   Daren’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (26:22)      Cloud is the starting point for anyone starting off in the data space, like Data Factory but at the same time have respect for the old like SQL and Oracle implementations.   Daren’s advice to keep herself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (27:34)      He implements piece by piece and focus on a stream lined model and THEN figure where he can add the additional capabilities along the way   He DOES NOT go ahead and grab the latest announcement every day, instead he focuses on the core and add capability to the core.

        "excerpt":"                                   In this episode we talk with Thomas Maurer who works as a Cloud Advocate in Microsoft. We talk about how Azure Stack helped his customer realize the value of Azure even when there were compliance need for the data not to leave the customer’s datacenters. Tom talks about how he keeps himself up to date with everything that’s happening in the Cloud world and his e-commerce website too.   Thomas’s journey on how he got to where he is today (01:44)      When he was starting off his career, he bet on Hyper-V v/s Active Directory because it was a niche technology then. He then focused on Hyper-V, System Center suite of products.   Hyper-V was great for a while, but he wanted to focus on the next big thing – which is Azure. He started on Azure from when it was called “Windows Azure”   We also discuss how cloud is constantly evolving based on customer’s feedback – Tom talks about his role as Cloud Advocate and how he bridges the gap between the engineering teams and the customers.   Interesting projects that Thomas has worked on (07:09)      Azure stack – A luxury product company wanted to leverage Azure and the global scale. However they had a requirement that pictures of new products couldn’t leave their datacenter – and this policy was just written in stone. Azure Stack (now called Azure Stack Hub) enabled them to run IaaS and PaaS using ARM templates using the same familiar CI/CD tools.   We also discuss Azure Arc how it enhances our hybrids story by extending Azure’s data services to on premise. With Microsoft – Hybrid was always in mind when we planned for any new features. We also talk about how Azure management plane – ARM APIs, RBAC and Azure Policies extends to on premise – using Azure ARC.   Thomas’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (15:14)      MSLearn is the single go to place for anyone starting off in the Azure space.   You don’t need an Azure subscription, all you would need is a Microsoft account. This not only provides you with the theory and videos but also provides you with a sandbox Azure account where you can use it as a demo lab.   Apart from MSLearn, the Azure certification is a good path to verify your skills.   If you are already an architect Azure Architect Center, Cloud Adoption Framework and Migration Center are good places to start.   Thomas’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (20:30)      Acceptance – “that you can’t possibly not know everything about everything. Have a T shaped learning methodology”   He spends his morning reading through RSS feeds – on what’s new, what was updated and announcements.   He follows Microsoft’s blogs, connects to the PG using twitter.   Tom likes to build stuff to learn. Once he builds it he explains it using a blog or presentation. This forces him to know a little more about the topic than what is required.

        "excerpt":"                                   If you are in the data science field or aspiring to be in the data science field you are going to love this episode. In this episode we talk with Phil Coachman who works as a Data Scientist/Principal Cloud Solution Architect in Microsoft. We talk about Phil’s journey starting with the Bing, Xbox and Windows 10 team to his current role. We also demystify “who a data scientist” really is and what it take to be one. We talk about a really interesting and cool Train derailment prevention project using AI, Machine Learning, IoT sensors and IOT edge which is currently in production and has been deployed to 4 continents. Phil also gives you 4 ways on how you can keep up and learn everything you need to know about Machine Learning.   Enjoy listening !   Phil’s journey on how he got to where he is today (01:52)      Phil started off working with a project codenamed “Live search” (now called Bing) 12 years ago- and he had the opportunity to work on tools like Hadoop, Spark and other big data tools and capabilities.   Working with big data processing with 100’s of PB for Bing, Xbox and Windows 10 – he understood the relationship between data and insights and naturally progressed into a Cloud Solution Architect specializing in the data science field.   Demystify the role “data scientist” (03:59)      Most people who have the title of Data Scientist are actually doing Data Analyst roles where they work on Excel. The key is a “scientific method”, creating a null hypothesis and going about to prove it you are not really doing data science. You could be doing data analytics or data engineering or data mining.   The future of Data Science as Phil’s perceives it – Data analyst are gradually moving towards data scientists as tools become easier for machine learning and deep learning.            Excel, Power BI makes it easier to do data science without even realizing you are doing it. Tools like DataRobot, Julia, and Azure automated Machine Learning makes it even easier to figure out a what is a good model without having to know how the actual algorithms work behind it.           Interesting projects that Phil has worked on (07:57)      Train Derailment Prevention – Customer who deals a lot with Trains had a lot of trains across the globe with 1000s of sensors across the train like heat, vibration etc. Their goal was to monitor the trains and also be alerted when a train derailed (for trains running in remote location like rainforests it will be harder to find derailed trains).   POC was using Raspberrry Pi and a toy train set inside their lab. A model built in R and get into Azure stream analytics and get alerted when a train derails. The POC was a success. Big Edge devices were placed on the train. The production was then deployed across the globe and they used this to sell the solution to other train manufacturers and vendors across the globe.   As a phase 2 – they are picking up sound frequencies from the wheels to predict if a bearing is going to fail – so that they can proactively fix it and thereby reducing train delays.   The resource constraint also meant that the solution had to work with 2G network connectivity which was overcome using IoT edge to bring AI closer to the source as possible.   Phil’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution and Data Science space (14:26)      Holistic understanding of the other pieces involved in a solution is critical to deliver a quality solution – example Networking, Governance, Security, Identity understanding is critical even for a data science project.   Collaboration is crucial for a success solution architect to leverage the strengths of the team.   Phil’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (16:42)      Top 4 ways he keeps himself up to date:            TowardsDataScience – site he follows this – articles from students, practitioners and professors       MachineLearningMastery – similar to the above site       ACM – Latest from the university and research papers.       Kaggle – ton of data sets and new challenges. It helps you take out the tunnel vision and take a broader picture.           For work life balance –            Phil blocks time on his calendar for learning and keeping up with the latest updates.       When he is travelling he uses hotel hours to keep up with new things.

        "excerpt":"                                   In this episode we talk to Eddie who works as a Principal Commercial Software Engineer @ Microsoft. He has also co-authored the book Kubernetes Best practices along with Brendan Burns and is a contributor for CNCF/K8s. This episode is jam-packed with super good K8s content and we talk about the following:      Eddie’s journey   Learning path for K8s to someone coming from the Windows world(really good analogies to make it sticky)   He breaks down the K8s certification - and what it takes to get certified and who should take which exam   Future of K8s   How to be part of the K8s community   Interesting Talent Management system project using Kubernetes   When NOT to use K8s   Eddie’s journey on how he got to where he is today (01:02)      Eddie has been with Microsoft for over 10 years with an open source background all through. When Microsoft moved to the Cloud, he started seeing a lot of the workloads were driven by Open Source projects and he decided to make a career switch by joining as a Global Black belt in the Open Source team.   He then moved to the Cloud Native application development black belt team.   In his current role as a Commercial Software engineer he does a code-with customers using the open source methodologies. Majority of the code is out there in the open unless proprietary code is requested by the customer. They create reusable code that is resuable across different stacks and different industries.   Learning path for Kubernetes to someone coming from the Windows world      Based on Eddie’s experience teaching and conducting workshops across the world one of the biggest roadblocks he has seen is learning the bash shell and the basic Linux commands. (you don’t have to go super deep).   Depending on your background you might want to specialize and prepare the learning plan.            If you are a security person - then an understanding of cgroup, namespaces etc are essential.       If you are an app developer running your apps in a container - you don’t have to deep experience in those.       If an operator you need to go deep dive on topics such as - “run as user” etc.       Where things overlap is networking - networking is same in windows and Linux. (for the most part)       Once you get the fundamental concepts, move to Kubernetes and he gives a very good analogy of seeing your containers as process in Windows       Looks at containers as a process. He compares calc.exe in the windows world as similar to running a container based off an image. Multiple copies of the calc.exe process is similar to running multiple container instances. When we make a functional change example change calc.exe - it is similar to updating image for the container - and rerun the new version of the new calc.exe.                    Container is just a PID at the end of the day. Only difference is that we can look at the PID tree.                           Best practices for taking the Kubernetes certification exam   There are two certification paths for anyone interested in the Kubernetes certification     Certified Kubernetes Administrator(CKA) - This one needs very heavy understanding of how the underlying components of Kubernetes work. If you are not an operator and building Kubernetes cluster, this may not be the exam you want to take. In a cloud hosted scenario, most of the the control plane components might be abstracted for you.            Kelsey Hightower’s Kubernetes the Hard way is a great starting point. He also recommends Kubernetes up and running. This builds on top of the infrastructure that you built with KTHW.   *{: .notice–success} Exam tip : Its all about time management. It’s a 3 hour and you will be using every second of the three hours. Know “kubectl” very well.           Certified Kubernetes Application Developer(CKAD) - If the etcd and other control plane components are abstracted for you, and you are someone who is using Kubernetes for application development and deployment then this exam might be the one for you.   Future of Kubernetes      Eventually its going to be like the hypervisor. Eventually the goal of Kubernetes is to be “boring” - it’s a master API to get workloads running. The idea of understanding how the backend components work - should be irrelevant. Customization of the API would be the future where end users extend what it was originally created for.   Now that Kubernetes is in the enterprise - understanding the needs and effectively make it useful for large Enterprise customers is in pipeline   Be a part of the Kubernetes community      Be a part of the community and get involved - you don’t necessarily have to be a developer - there are plenty of ways you can help out.   How ?            Find a Special Interest Group(SIG) under Kubernetes.io website.           Interesting projects that Eddie has worked on      Talent Management system project in a million employee company - Eddie talks about a Data science project which builds real time models using Azure machine learning toolsets. They would then train all of the models them and serve up the model using web services using AKS using a BOT service. Which led to promotion based on data points. And provided a ROI on the talent for the investment that they had made on the talent.   When NOT to use Kubernetes      Even though a lot of progress has been made on the “operators” front - Kubernetes was not made initially for stateful data. Stateful applications as of today still require a lot of work this is constantly being improved on as we speak. But it might be easier to just consume a PaaS service already provided by many of the cloud providers for stateful services   Eddie’s advice to keep abreast of all the changes happening in the Open Source world      Keeps his ear to the ground and keeps track of all the graduated and incubating project list from the CNCF and understanding all of them work together is  something he closely tracks.   KubeWeekly newsletter - curated email listing which is sent every week from all over the internet centered around Kubernetes.   CNCF meetup groups - he actively participates and is a coach of the Austin CNCF meetups   Attend Kube-Con in person or virtually using YouTube.

How to set this up ?      Step 1 - Enable Feature - You would need to enable the feature from PowerShell. (Run as administrator - will need a restart)   Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux           Step 2 - Pick Distribution &amp; Complete Install - Here is the list of the distributions of Linux that you can install using the Microsoft Store:                       Ubuntu 16.04 LTS                        Ubuntu 18.04 LTS                        OpenSUSE Leap 15                        OpenSUSE Leap 42                        SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12                        SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15                        Kali Linux                        Debian GNU/Linux                        Fedora Remix for WSL                        Pengwin                        Pengwin Enterprise                        Alpine WSL                   I chose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for my example and complete the install by providing the user name and password for your instance:                   Step 3 - Upgrade the packages - Run the following commands to upgrade the packages       This command does not automatically install new versions of the software. It updates the package lists for upgrades -  for packages that might need an upgrade or new packages that might just  fetches the list of update packages ( but does not download them yet)   sudo apt-get update   This command downloads the latest packages based on the previous update list   sudo apt-get upgrade   Windows Terminal   What does it do ?
