        "excerpt":"                                   In this episode we talk with Thomas Maurer who works as a Cloud Advocate in Microsoft. We talk about how Azure Stack helped his customer realize the value of Azure even when there were compliance need for the data not to leave the customer’s datacenters. Tom talks about how he keeps himself up to date with everything that’s happening in the Cloud world and his e-commerce website too.   Thomas’s journey on how he got to where he is today (01:44)      When he was starting off his career, he bet on Hyper-V v/s Active Directory because it was a niche technology then. He then focused on Hyper-V, System Center suite of products.   Hyper-V was great for a while, but he wanted to focus on the next big thing – which is Azure. He started on Azure from when it was called “Windows Azure”   We also discuss how cloud is constantly evolving based on customer’s feedback – Tom talks about his role as Cloud Advocate and how he bridges the gap between the engineering teams and the customers.   Interesting projects that Thomas has worked on (07:09)      Azure stack – A luxury product company wanted to leverage Azure and the global scale. However they had a requirement that pictures of new products couldn’t leave their datacenter – and this policy was just written in stone. Azure Stack (now called Azure Stack Hub) enabled them to run IaaS and PaaS using ARM templates using the same familiar CI/CD tools.   We also discuss Azure Arc how it enhances our hybrids story by extending Azure’s data services to on premise. With Microsoft – Hybrid was always in mind when we planned for any new features. We also talk about how Azure management plane – ARM APIs, RBAC and Azure Policies extends to on premise – using Azure ARC.   Thomas’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution space (15:14)      MSLearn is the single go to place for anyone starting off in the Azure space.   You don’t need an Azure subscription, all you would need is a Microsoft account. This not only provides you with the theory and videos but also provides you with a sandbox Azure account where you can use it as a demo lab.   Apart from MSLearn, the Azure certification is a good path to verify your skills.   If you are already an architect Azure Architect Center, Cloud Adoption Framework and Migration Center are good places to start.   Thomas’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (20:30)      Acceptance – “that you can’t possibly not know everything about everything. Have a T shaped learning methodology”   He spends his morning reading through RSS feeds – on what’s new, what was updated and announcements.   He follows Microsoft’s blogs, connects to the PG using twitter.   Tom likes to build stuff to learn. Once he builds it he explains it using a blog or presentation. This forces him to know a little more about the topic than what is required.

        "excerpt":"                                   If you are in the data science field or aspiring to be in the data science field you are going to love this episode. In this episode we talk with Phil Coachman who works as a Data Scientist/Principal Cloud Solution Architect in Microsoft. We talk about Phil’s journey starting with the Bing, Xbox and Windows 10 team to his current role. We also demystify “who a data scientist” really is and what it take to be one. We talk about a really interesting and cool Train derailment prevention project using AI, Machine Learning, IoT sensors and IOT edge which is currently in production and has been deployed to 4 continents. Phil also gives you 4 ways on how you can keep up and learn everything you need to know about Machine Learning.   Enjoy listening !   Phil’s journey on how he got to where he is today (01:52)      Phil started off working with a project codenamed “Live search” (now called Bing) 12 years ago- and he had the opportunity to work on tools like Hadoop, Spark and other big data tools and capabilities.   Working with big data processing with 100’s of PB for Bing, Xbox and Windows 10 – he understood the relationship between data and insights and naturally progressed into a Cloud Solution Architect specializing in the data science field.   Demystify the role “data scientist” (03:59)      Most people who have the title of Data Scientist are actually doing Data Analyst roles where they work on Excel. The key is a “scientific method”, creating a null hypothesis and going about to prove it you are not really doing data science. You could be doing data analytics or data engineering or data mining.   The future of Data Science as Phil’s perceives it – Data analyst are gradually moving towards data scientists as tools become easier for machine learning and deep learning.            Excel, Power BI makes it easier to do data science without even realizing you are doing it. Tools like DataRobot, Julia, and Azure automated Machine Learning makes it even easier to figure out a what is a good model without having to know how the actual algorithms work behind it.           Interesting projects that Phil has worked on (07:57)      Train Derailment Prevention – Customer who deals a lot with Trains had a lot of trains across the globe with 1000s of sensors across the train like heat, vibration etc. Their goal was to monitor the trains and also be alerted when a train derailed (for trains running in remote location like rainforests it will be harder to find derailed trains).   POC was using Raspberrry Pi and a toy train set inside their lab. A model built in R and get into Azure stream analytics and get alerted when a train derails. The POC was a success. Big Edge devices were placed on the train. The production was then deployed across the globe and they used this to sell the solution to other train manufacturers and vendors across the globe.   As a phase 2 – they are picking up sound frequencies from the wheels to predict if a bearing is going to fail – so that they can proactively fix it and thereby reducing train delays.   The resource constraint also meant that the solution had to work with 2G network connectivity which was overcome using IoT edge to bring AI closer to the source as possible.   Phil’s advice to anyone who is starting off in the Cloud Solution and Data Science space (14:26)      Holistic understanding of the other pieces involved in a solution is critical to deliver a quality solution – example Networking, Governance, Security, Identity understanding is critical even for a data science project.   Collaboration is crucial for a success solution architect to leverage the strengths of the team.   Phil’s advice to keep himself abreast of all the changes happening in the cloud world (16:42)      Top 4 ways he keeps himself up to date:            TowardsDataScience – site he follows this – articles from students, practitioners and professors       MachineLearningMastery – similar to the above site       ACM – Latest from the university and research papers.       Kaggle – ton of data sets and new challenges. It helps you take out the tunnel vision and take a broader picture.           For work life balance –            Phil blocks time on his calendar for learning and keeping up with the latest updates.       When he is travelling he uses hotel hours to keep up with new things.

        "title": "how goals failed me - and what worked in 2019",
        "excerpt":"Voice in my head: Why on earth would someone want to listen to my systems or routine ???! You must be crazy.   I acknowledge but still ignore the voice and continue writing, Why ?? You have these folks to blame - Dona Sarkar , Obvious to you, amazing to others and Show Your Work.   I have always been a very ambitious goal setter all my life, but have been a terrible failure when it comes to execution - it would never last more than a few days. Something changed in 2019, I re-/read these amazing books -      Deep Work - Cal Newport   How to fail at almost everything and still win big - Scott Adams   Atomic habits - James Clear   If you haven’t read these books - stop reading this post and go read those books - will be a better use of your time   Extracting the essence from these three books, I am now a strong believer of incremental tiny boring progress and building a system rather than an ambitious fancy goal. This has helped me have the longest streak to sticking to these routines.   Mindfulness Meditation   I’m not going to delve into the benefits of mindfulness, there are a gazillion articles out there. For me this is a keystone habit - and the most important one           What do I do      I practice this method. In plain English here’s what I do - focus and observe your breath and body sensations - in a nonjudgmental and equanimous way - THAT’S IT - it’s as simple as that - I SWEAR. I try to aim for 20 mins/day but I’m not too ambitious even if I can get done 1 minute - I consider that a win for the day ( Systems v/s goals)            How has it helped me      Focus, Clarity and creativity - it’s amazing how these foundational skills affect every single aspect of your life       Screen time   Screen addiction is real. If I was bored or when I was in the train with nothing to do - I used to stare at my phone screen. I had to change this, because I have had a taste of how useful boredom can be for creativity in the past - but never managed to stick to the discipline.           What did I do       I followed Cal Newport’s advice - uninstalled all the apps which was distracting the most (for me it was - WhatsApp, Facebook) for 30 days.            How has it helped me       It helped me feel “boredom” again !! I know this sounds crazy - but trust me boredom is super essential. And now I have reinstalled the apps and use a screen time limit of 6mins/day - so it’s more intentional when I use these apps.       One new thing a day   I used to mindlessly consume lots of content and not really absorbing it or internalizing it.           What did I do      Starting late 2019, I have a tiny book where I make 1 or 2 sentence notes of what I learned that day (kept it small and atomic) - it could be from a podcast guest, my customers and colleagues who I work with, an article/book/video I watched, my 1.5 year daughter, my wife, the cashier at Walmart -ANYONE.            How has it helped me      I feel terrible when I miss a day of note taking, so all day this subconsciously helps put me in a mindset where I make it a point to learn at least one thing. I personally feel having this mindset has helped me learn and absorb so much from the amazing people around me and has provided me with new opportunities.       What I aim to add in 2020           Physical exercise      I’m aiming for 10 minutes/day of really slow jogging and gradually add on if and when I feel comfortable.            Morning pages      Here is how to do it -750 free flowing words as soon as you wake up. The few days I have written morning pages in the past - I have had really crazy unique ideas and I had no idea how they came to me, which have totally caught me by surprise. But again this requires a certain discipline and I’m hoping to build this muscle this year.       www.azuremonk.com  ","categories": ["productivity"],
