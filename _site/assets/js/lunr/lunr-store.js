It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.   I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.   Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.   Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.   Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.  ","categories": ["docs","Post Formats"],

Costello: The guy on first base.   Abbott: Who is on first.   Costello: Well, what are you askin’ me for?   Abbott: I’m not asking you–I’m telling you. Who is on first.   Costello: I’m asking you–who’s on first?   Abbott: That’s the man’s name.   Costello: That’s who’s name?   Abbott: Yes.   Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?   Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man’s entitled to it.   Costello: Who is?   Abbott: Yes.   Costello: So who gets it?   Abbott: Why shouldn’t he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.   Costello: Who’s wife?   Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.   Costello: Who does?   Abbott: Absolutely.   Costello: Well, all I’m trying to find out is what’s the guy’s name on first base?   Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.   Costello: I’m not asking you who’s on second.   Abbott: Who’s on first!   Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?   Abbott: Oh, absolutely.   Costello: The left fielder’s name?   Abbott: Why.   Costello: I don’t know, I just thought I’d ask.   Abbott: Well, I just thought I’d tell you.   Costello: Then tell me who’s playing left field?   Abbott: Who’s playing first.   Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder’s name?   Abbott: Why.   Costello: Because.   Abbott: Oh, he’s center field.   Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?   Abbott: Wouldn’t this be a fine team without a pitcher?   Costello: Tell me the pitcher’s name.   Abbott: Tomorrow.   Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball–me being a good catcher–I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?   Abbott: Now, that’s he first thing you’ve said right.   Costello: I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!   Abbott: Don’t get excited. Take it easy.   Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don’t know. I don’t know throws it back to tomorrow–a triple play.   Abbott: Yeah, it could be.   Costello: Another guy gets up and it’s a long ball to center.   Abbott: Because.   Costello: Why? I don’t know. And I don’t care.   Abbott: What was that?   Costello: I said, I DON’T CARE!   Abbott: Oh, that’s our shortstop!  ","categories": ["test","Post Formats"],

        "excerpt":"This post has reading time disabled. The estimated time that it takes to read this post should not be showing if read_time: false is set in _config.yml or in this post’s YAML Front Matter.   If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.   I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.   Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.   Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.   Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.  ","categories": ["docs"],

Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.   Left Align   This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.   Center Align   This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.   Right Align   This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.   Justify Align   This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.  ","categories": ["docs","Markup"],

Grab a paddle and let’s get started.      The image above happens to be centered.    The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.   As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thing. Mission accomplished!   And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.      The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.      And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.   In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah — Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.   And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!         Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.   The figure above happens to be centered.

        "title": "Gemified Theme -- Alpha Release",
        "excerpt":"Jekyll themes distributed as Ruby gems are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to “install it”. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to “upgrade it”.   If you’re interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:      Support for a theme assets folder was recently added to Jekyll core, but has yet to be released or rolled into the github-pages gem. Meaning you can’t use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet… locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don’t mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.   Windows users can’t currently use themes packaged as gems due to a bug with file paths in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a fix is on the way soon.   Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue.   If you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the _includes, _layouts, _sass partials, or assets this should be quick and painless.   Step 1: Remove Theme Files   Remove _includes, _layouts, _sass, assets folders and files within. You won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled in the theme.   If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as overrides to the versions bundled with the theme.   Step 2: Update Gemfile   In order to test you’ll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes.   Start by replacing gem \"github-pages\" or gem \"jekyll\" with the following:   gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"   Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem:   gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"`   When finished your Gemfile should look something like this:   source \"https://rubygems.org\"  gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"  group :jekyll_plugins do   # gem \"jekyll-archives\"   gem \"jekyll-paginate\"   gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"   gem \"jekyll-gist\"   gem \"jekyll-feed\" end   Step 3: Run Bundler   Run bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems.   Step 4: Install the Theme   Add theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" to your _config.yml file.   If you’re migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn’t have to change anything else after this. If it’s a new site consult then docs to properly config.   Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now assets/images but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml.   Step 5: jekyll new Tweaks   If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to _data/ and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.      _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation   _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentation   You’ll also need to:      Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.html with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html.   Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.   Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using).     That’s it! If all goes well running bundle exec jekyll serve should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you’re testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.   File an issue   Thanks!  ","categories": ["docs","Jekyll"],

        "excerpt":"Hot on the heels of Jekyll v3.3.0 is a beta release of Minimal Mistakes… as a gemified theme.   minimal-mistakes-jekyll can only be used with Jekyll proper. If you’re hosting on GitHub Pages or using that gem the theme won’t work. 3rd party themes haven’t been white-listed so it’s a no go for now.   Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue.

Step 2: Update Gemfile   Replace gem \"github-pages or gem \"jekyll\" with gem \"jekyll\", \"~&gt; 3.3.0\". You’ll need the latest version of Jekyll1 for Minimal Mistakes to work and load all of the /assets/ properly.   Add the Minimal Mistakes theme gem:   gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"   When finished your Gemfile should look something like this:   source \"https://rubygems.org\"  gem \"jekyll\", \"~&gt; 3.3.0\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"   Step 3: Run Bundler   Run bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install/update Jekyll and the theme.
