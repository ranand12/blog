in my day job i work as a [cloud solution architect at microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/ranand12) serving the new york city metro region. when i’m not working i’m keeping up with the new cool cloud-y things, meditating, biking or creating online content.

the cloud computing space is facing a “tappers and listeners” problem and this site is my humble attempt at bridging the gap. like a wise man once said 

“you don’t really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother”
