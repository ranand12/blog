### what Iâ€™m doing now (oct 2021)

__


**personal**

have had a lot of changes in my personal life over the past few months - lost someone very dear to me. making peace with the loss and accepting reality (definitely not easy)

**disconnect** 

I am mostly going to be disconnected from most forms of social media - to regain some of the lost momentum and focus over the past few months and create something impactful. call and email would be the best way to reach me

**career**

*learnings*

everytime I have wanted to take the cka exam (certified kubernetes administrator) in the past, a ton of things have cropped up and I have end up procrastinating almost always. I have decided to double down on and take this exam by the end of oct 2021. 


*community* 

continue to work on aks and azure content for my [azuremonk](https://www.azuremonk.com/video) video channel. will upload the scaling in aks video by oct 2021. aiming to create 1 video every two weeks consistently. *fingers crossed*

*application* 

over the past few months have consumed copious amount of content on learning, productivity and focus - but have embarrassingly applied very few of them. will be applying the things i have consumed and report back to you on what worked and what did not.

**fitness** 

aiming to complete a very challenging winter trek in the month of december - preparing for that by alternating the week between - walking, slow jogging, suryanamaskar - for now, while continuing to be consistent with the daily meditation habit
